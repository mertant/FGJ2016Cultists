## Game summary

Stage 1: gather materials for your summoning

Stage 2: fight with your demons

### Demon combat

An attack has three parts: the windup animation (e.g. pulling a fist back), the attack point (when the fist connects and deals damage), and the backswing (the cooldown after attacking). You cannot move during an animation. Taking damage stuns you for a moment and stops your animation stops. However, the backswing is slightly longer than the stun, so that you can move away after being hit, and aren't stunlocked infinitely.


Ranged attacks have a longer animation than melee attacks, so spamming ranged attacks or aiming badly can be punished by charging in and punching.
